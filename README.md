# Love-At First Sight: Matrimonial Website Project
This is a front-end web development project for a premium matchmaking and social networking platform titled "Love-At First Sight." The website is designed to facilitate finding life partners through an innovation-led approach, moving beyond traditional matrimonial services by incorporating social networking elements.

## Project Overview
The project consists of a multi-page website that allows users to explore the service, view success stories, and browse potential matches (profiles for "Him" and "Her"). It features a clean, responsive-ready design with a consistent theme across all pages.

### Key Features

  Dynamic Landing Page: Features a hero section with a "Wedding Journey" entry form and a dropdown for quick gender-based searches.
  
  Success Stories: A dedicated section displaying "Happy Stories" from couples who met through the platform using a card-based layout.
  
  User Profiles: Interactive profile pages for both men and women, showcasing details like age, profession, and personal bios.
  
  Authentication Flow: Includes functional UI for both Login and Sign Up pages.
  
  Responsive Styling: Managed through external CSS files for modular design and easy maintenance.
  
  Integrated Social Media: Footer links to major social platforms and a corporate address section.

### Technologies Used
